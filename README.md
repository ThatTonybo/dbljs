# dbljs
An incredibly simple to use wrapper for discordbots.org, supporting the API and webhooks. Guaranteed to be kept up to date.

## Install
dbljs can be installed using npm
```
npm install dbljs
```

## Usage
To create a new instance of dbljs, require it and supply your bot's token, and an optional `options` object.
```js
const dbljs = require('dbljs');
const token = 'Your discordbots.org API token';

const API = new dbljs(token, {});
```
You can now start using the API wrapper. For more information, check out the documentation ~~that's coming soon~~.
